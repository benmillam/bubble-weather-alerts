# Bubble Weather Alerts

[Giant bubbles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXsPqUFsArM) are best under [ideal weather conditions](https://soapbubble.fandom.com/wiki/Ideal_Conditions)!

This Python package (will) check the weather and send alerts when a good bubble day is forecast.

This is a work in progress, and chiefly an exercise as I'm reading and learning about [test-driven development](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) and [object-oriented design principles](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/). It's also my first time using [VIM](https://www.vim.org/).
